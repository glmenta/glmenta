# Hey There! I'm Geryko! ðŸ˜„

I'm a software developer who switched gears from the healthcare world to dive into my love for creating stuff on my computer. Fresh out of App Academy, I also have a background in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior. My time in healthcare taught me great teamwork skills, and I've been quick to pick up new software engineering tech along the way!
  
## About me ðŸ¤”
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making a website for a local food catering business!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning how to implement AWS for my apps and diving deep into data structures and algorithms!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I also love to breakdance, watch anime, play games and go to the gym!
- ðŸ§  Another fun fact: I am born in the Philippines and I am fluent in both Tagalog and English!
